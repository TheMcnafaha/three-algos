    <h1>Test 3 algorithms!!!</h1>
    <section class="explenation">
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>This is a quick example of how different search algorithms perfoms in terms of <i>steps</i>. The test will
            involve you answering the logic for the algorithms evertime they need to make a <i>step</i> while the
            computer program keeps track of how many steps each algorithm has done so far.</p>

        <p>A <i>step</i> is defined as the any time the algorithm begins to search again (for a more nerdy defenition, a
            <i>step</i> is any time the algorithm enters or reenters a loop or function). Thus, the fastest algorithm
            will be the one that takes the least <i>steps</i> (or searches) to find your number from a list of numbers.
        </p>

        <p>For example: You are given a list of all the integers from 0 to 100 (i.e a number list from 0 to 100)and want
            to find the number 59. If algorithm A takes 59 steps to find your number while algorithm B takes 7 steps,
            algorithm B would be declared the faster algoy

    <h2>Set Up</h2>

    <section class="setup">
        <p>To begin our algo test you need to do two things: (1) make a list of numbers from <i>start</i> to <i>end</i>, and (2) pick a  <i>number</i> from that list.
         The only restrictions are that you can only have integers from 0 to 10,000,000; the <i>start</i> must be less than the <i>end</i>; and that your picked <i>number</i> must be in-between your <i>start</i> and <i>end</i>
        </p>
